In Query response, there is an issue remaining 
tagged_response_id (containing the id of the table in subsequent row)
If one row deleted (the ID of that row is present in other row) is also deleted (for example 2nd row)
But if( the id of 2nd row present in subsequent row in tagged_response_id) that row do not deleted( that's the issue) 

late on reslove that issue !
