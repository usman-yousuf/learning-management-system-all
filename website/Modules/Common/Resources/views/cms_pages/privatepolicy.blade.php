                        <p>Your personal data will be stored by “Room A to Z” no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. </p>

In case your account expires, or you decide to delete your account “Room A to Z” retains your personal data not longer than <span class="bg-warning">90 days</span> after the account is expired. </p>
                        <p>However, in case of conflict situations in progress “Room A to Z” may store personal data for <span class="bg-warning">180 days</span> period or more if the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by law to which the controller is subject in case of an expired account or in case data subject requested to delete his personal data. Upon the expiry of this period or earlier, if a conflict situation is settled, all personal data gets deleted</p>
                        <p>In case your last activity on “Room A to Z”, as of the last payment date, <span class="bg-warning">was more than 180 (one hundred eighty)</span> days ago, your account will be considered expired and gets deleted.

                        <h5><strong>Your rights as data subject regarding your personal data “Room A to Z” processes: </strong></h5>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>right of confirmation - to obtain from “Room A to Z” the confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed;</li>
                            <li>right of access to your personal data processed by “Room A to Z”; </li>
                            <li>right to rectification – ask “Room A to Z” to have incomplete personal data requiring corrections completed; </li>
                            <li>right to erasure (right to be forgotten) – request “Room A to Z” to erase personal data. In most cases “Room A to Z” will erase it unless otherwise required by legislation; </li>
                            <ul type="circle">
                                <li>If one of the reasons applies, please contact us, as instructed at the end of this Privacy Policy. We shall promptly ensure that the request is complied with immediately. These requests are free of charge. </li>
                                <li>If you believe that our use of your data violates your rights, you can lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority. </li>
                                <li>Please, note that when the processing of your personal data is carried for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to such processing without providing any justification and we will no longer process your data with such direct marketing purposes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>right of restriction of processing. For example, you could contest the accuracy of your personal data or in case “Room A to Z” is not interested in processing of your personal data any longer, but you want “Room A to Z” to do this for different reasons, for example, to bring some claim for somebody and, instead of the erasure of information, its processing will be just restricted. </li>
                            <li>right to data portability - to have your personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others; </li>
                            <li>right to object to processing of your personal data by “Room A to Z” when the processing is related to the performance of our task carried in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. The other case is if we process your data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party and you believe that such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. If you make a request with objection to processing, we will no longer process the personal data unless we are able to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing; </li>
                            <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us. After we at “Room A to Z” receive such withdrawal request from you, we will process it in a timely manner and we will no longer process your personal data, unless otherwise is set by law. </li>
